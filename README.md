## Project

Project-03 was meant to introduce basic HTML and CSS concepts. In this project I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge about:

- forms to collect data through the web;
- input types existing in HTML (text, password, number and checkbox);
- tag types (select and text-area);
- functioning of forms in HTML (action and method attributes);
- types of methods that can be passed through a form (GET and POST);
- it was shown how a Google search works (using the tag to pass text, hidden and submit inputs);
- how to use HTML tags &lt; e &gt;
- input of type url and number;
- &lt; textarea &gt; HTML tag and accessibility fixes
- how to style the "select" field through CSS;
- input of type email, password, date and time;
- way to customize a checkbox type input in CSS;
- dealing with positioning, using pseudo-classes and working with accessibility;
- insert a "submit" button on the page and customize it according to figma's layout;
- validate the forms that were mandatory to fill in with the "require" property within the inputs.
